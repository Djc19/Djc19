  <h2>Mountain biking</h2>
  <p>Saint-Luc, Switzerland
High in the giddy, vertical world of the Anniviers valley, Saint-Luc offers quintessential Swiss singletrack set against seriously stunning backdrops. A small but hardcore park adds some adrenaline to the mix. The small resort of Saint-Luc isn’t an obvious choice in this area: it’s nearby Zermatt, which has the most famous backdrops and singletracks in the business, while Crans-Montana in the Sierre valley below has the established park scene. However, the riding at Saint-Luc is every bit as good, both in the park and out in the wilds. The funicular uplift is open much earlier than its neighbours, and the sunny slopes mean dry and dusty trails by early spring, so you can get your big-mountain singletrack fix before the main biking season really kicks off.</p>
  <h3>snowboarding</h3>
  <p> Davos
Snowboard Guide rating 10 out of 10 “	The best overall resort in Switzerland offering something for everyone. Huge pisted area and excellent freeriding spread across 5 mountains, and not to mention the terrain park and 2 halpipes.</p>
